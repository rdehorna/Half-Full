		Bipolar disorder type I

<b>Definition</b>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that is characterized by episodes of mania, hypomania and major depression. One of the most important facts to keep in mind is that both of these disorders have an onset that is mixed in nature, and difficult to predict or regulate. Episodes of mania are often mixed with feelings of depression, or vice versa, in different ratios.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Type I: Maniac episodes and almost always with major depressive and hypomanic episodes
</p>
<p align="justify">
Type II: At least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode and NO manic episodes
</p>
 <p align="justify">
Both of these types of bipolar disorders can be set into motion by various triggers. Triggers can include traumatic or difficult life situations, relationship status changes, lack of sleep, too much stress, chaotic environments, or many other things that are unique but significant to different individuals. Not only is it critical for the individual to understand what his or her own triggers are, but it is also crucial that the individual can recognize when their mood is not improving, and has been consistently getting worse. Changes in daily life can cause an extreme onset of mania, manic-depression, or depression that can be difficult to manage when it is unexpected.

<b>Risk Factors</b>
</p>
<p align="justify">
	<ul>
<li>A parent or sibling with bipolar disorder</li>
<li>Periods of high stress</li>
<li>Drug or alcohol abuse</li>
<li> Prior depressive episode</li>
<li> Traumatic experiences in life or life changes</li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify">
<b>Treatment</b>
</p>
<p align="justify">
The correct diagnosis is necessary for the best treatment with a skilled psychiatrist. The medications may include mood stabilizers and longitudinal care is needed for the best outcome. Support and counseling from a treatment team may also be recommended. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Importance of monitoring
Since bipolar disorder is an unpredictable mix of mania, hypomania, and depressive feelings, this condition is therefore also very difficult to manage by both medications and lifestyle changes. It is especially important to be able to monitor moods and thoughts over time in a daily or almost daily fashion such that the patient and/or physician can note if there are abrupt changes in mood or a failure to maintain or manage a certain state of being. In that case, interventions or changes to medications/lifestyle would be necessary to maintain well-being and to help allow for an individual to remain highly functional.
