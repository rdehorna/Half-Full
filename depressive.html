		Major depressive disorder
		</h2>
		<p align="justify">
		The most common psychiatric disorder seen in the general population is depression. More often than not, symptoms of depression are not directly addressed or spoken about to primary care physicians. Only 50% of patients with major depressive disorder are identified. Depression is more than every day sadness and may interfere with the ability to perform daily tasks.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
<b>Definition by American Psychiatric Association DSM-5:</b>
		</p>
		<p>

<ol type="1">
<li> <u>Five or more </u> of the listed symptoms and <u>at least one</u> of them includes <i>depressed mood</i> or <i>loss of interest</i> or <i>pleasure</i>:</li>

</ol>
</p>
<p alignment="justify">
	<b>Risk Factors for Major Depressive Disorder</b>
The risk factors for depression involve genetic, medical health, environmental and social influences:
<ul>
 <li>Prior depressive episode</li>
 <li>Family history</li>
 <li>Female gender</li>
<li>Childhood trauma</li>
<li>Stressful life events</li>
<li>Poor social support</li>
<li>Serious medical illness</li>
<li>Dementia</li>
<li>Substance abuse</li>
	</p>
</ul>

<p alignment="justify">
<b>Treatment</b>
</p>
<p alignment="justify">
Depression can be successfully treated and treatment is more effective when depression is treated earlier. Talk to your healthcare provider about all your symptoms to determine the correct type of depression and treatment depending on severity. The treatment options includes psychotherapy or “talk therapy” and antidepressant medication. Talk therapy allows the individual to make a choice to involve a range of people from just the individual, family, friends, and group therapy. Half Full does not replace talk therapy but integrates into the treatment through the use of technology.
</p>
<p alignment="justify">
<b>Importance of monitoring</b>
</p>
<p alignment="justify">
Many of the antidepressant medications take time to work and therefore monitoring plays an important during this time. With the treatment for depression, monitoring with Half Full allows you to understand what is treatments are working for you when progress is sometimes difficult to see.
</p>
<p alignment="justify">
Depression is common and frequently undetected. Detecting depression is not enough to improve the clinical outcome. Clinical outcomes can be improved by seeking treatment and careful monitoring by the patient and help from Half Full.
