		Being diagnosed with a mood disorder such as major depression or bipolar disorder can

seem life­ altering. However, what does this diagnosis actually mean and how does it

impact your life?
		</p>
		<p align="justify">

Our initial pilot application targets pre­-professional and professional populations where it is

necessary to be a high­ functioning person in day­-to-­day life to perform your job. For some,

depression and certain mood disorders are more easily treatable with options such as

counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy, or medications that are only needed short­term. For

others, depression can be a life-long struggle that never seems to fully go away, and for which

there seems to be no definitive treatments (or long­-lasting solutions).
		</p>
		<p align="justify">

However, one step towards understanding and management of a mood disorder can be as

simple as mood tracking​. As we are all unique people, a diagnosis often only begins to

identify the tip of the iceberg and describe the possible reasons why you may be feeling the

way you are. The reasons for a depressed mood could be changes in brain neurotransmitters,

neuroanatomy, important life events, genetics, or other external/internal factors that result in

short­term to long­term conditions. In reality, a person’s mood is complicated and consists of

a mix of emotions, ideas, and thoughts. There is no black and white when it comes to how

you are feeling, as there can be many shades of color in between. The point is: mood is

ever­-changing and transient.

		</p>
		<p align="justify">
More importantly, understanding your own mood and seeing the trends over time can offer

you more options to take control of your own mood, and to help you identify what you need in

order to feel better. This analysis can even act as a contingency plan to alert you, your loved

ones, or your registered physician (if you should choose) that you may need some help. This

help may be changes in medications or in lifestyle. Either way, you will have another option to

better take control of your mood.</p>
<p align="justify">

Have you ever downloaded one of those depression apps that asks you to rate your mood or

feelings on a scale of 1­ to­ 10, or to use a slider bar between opposite words such as

“Depressed” and “Happy” or “Angry” and “Jovial”? Are you tired of this?

Take control of your life today by receiving texts/notifications every 2­ to 3 days, and having your

friends, family, or a kindred pre­-screened soul in the health professions help you keep track of

how you are doing.
